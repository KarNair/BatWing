This projects aims to replicate the bioinformatics analysis and approaches made by  Eckalbar et. al in [*Transcriptomic and epigenomic characterization of the developing bat wing*](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3537).


The study aimed to understand the developmental processes involved in the formation of bat wings

This repository contains code for genome analysis pipeline followed to replicate the study. This includes the code for:


* Quality Control and Trimming
* Genome Assembly
* Transcriptome assembly
* Genome Annotation and Differential Expression Analysis.
